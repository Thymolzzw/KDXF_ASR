1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:03,072
 In terms of autonomous control, we have a set of operators who are interested in.

2
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:07,680
 Why certain actions are being taken by, in this case, this autonomous vehicle?

3
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:10,240
 In some cases, the vehicle might be within sight.

4
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:15,360
 In other cases, the vehicle might be out of sight, meaning that the vehicle might have access to some situation Information.

5
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:17,408
 That they can't even see at that point in time.

6
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:23,040
 So when they want to interrogate this, they may want to do so in a post hoc situations such as after.

7
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:26,624
 After action analysis, or maybe even during the time period in which.

8
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:27,648
 The vehicle.

9
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,416
 Is up.

10
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,440
 Performing on a mission.

11
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:33,024
 So you can see, in both cases, explanations are critical to these users.

12
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:39,680
 So where the x e I program is all about is to address this fundamental trade off.

13
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,472
 For performance versus explain ability.

14
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:44,544
 You may be very familiar with by now.

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,568
 The uh.

16
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:49,152
 Advent of deep learning and how it's impacted this trade off.

17
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:52,736
 In particular, for certain types of applications, those in which.

18
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:55,040
 Uh, we're working with raw sensory data.

19
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:59,136
 Deep learning applications have been shown to be able to greatly increase learning performance.

20
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:04,256
 But there has often been the case that it's been in the sacrifice of explain ability.

21
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,792
 There's some notion of form.

22
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:07,840
 X AI.

23
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:12,448
 Is instead focused on the task of being able to increase explain ability.

24
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:14,496
 Without sacrificing learning from.

25
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,264
 Performance.

26
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,824
 So we're trying to go to the Top right hand side of that.

27
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,872
 Curly cues me that my graph that.

28
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,664
 The graph that you see there.

29
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:26,528
 Uh, in doing so, the goal is to be able to create a new generation.

30
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:29,600
 Of AI systems that are machine learning and able.

31
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:36,512
 In which users can understand uh, the uh, learned models understand why these predictions being generated.

32
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,328
 Uh, understand when they can trust the model.

33
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:43,168
 And be able to work with it effectively to manage it in upcoming.

34
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,448
 Critical applications.

35
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:48,288
 So that's a quick introduction to the x AI program.

36
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,568
 What are we doing next?

37
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,128
 Instead highlighting six contributions to the.

38
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:52,896
 To the program.

39
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,968
 The first three pertain to data analytics. And the latter three will be.

40
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,736
 Pertaining to.

41
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,016
 Autonomous control.

42
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:03,136
 So the first one here pertains to a method that's called rise. This is.

43
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:06,976
 Developed by the boston university sub team of uc berkeley.

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,072
 So rise or um, randomize, uh.

45
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,400
 Keep forgetting. Right? Randomized input sampling for explanations.

46
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,984
 Is focused on the first of those questions that you were looking at before.

47
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,520
 Why did you give me this prediction?

48
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:24,896
 So here we see a surprising prediction. It's saying from this aerial imagery. And what we're looking at.

49
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:28,480
 It appears to be a shopping mall. Instead predicting that a solar farm.

50
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,784
 Which begs the question as to why?
